title: RESTEasy: XML eXternal Entity (XXE) flaw
description: >
    RESTEasy permits XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attacks. If a RESTEasy endpoint is
    deployed, a user can submit a request containing an external XML entity. This
    XML entity will be resolved, allowing a remote attacker to read files in the 
    context of the user running the application server. This flaw affects DOM 
    Document, JAXB and Fast Infoset (FI) input.
