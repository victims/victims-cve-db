title: Hash table collisions CPU usage DoS
description: >
    A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative arrays.
    An attacker able to supply a large number of inputs to a Python application
    (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to a web application) that are used
    as keys when inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function
    collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of CPU time.
