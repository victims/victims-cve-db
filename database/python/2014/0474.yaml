title: "Django: MySQL typecasting"
description: >
    It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not
    properly perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker
    could use this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when
    processed by a Django application using a MySQL database, could have
    various application-specific impacts on the MySQL database.
