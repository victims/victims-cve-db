title: "python-keystoneclient: potential context confusion in Keystone middleware"
description: >
    When using the auth_token middleware with the memcached token cache
    enabled, a token for a different identity could be returned.
    An authenticated user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges
    by making repeated requests that could eventually allow the user to
    acquire the administrator's identity. Note that only keystone setups
    using auth_token with memcached were affected.
