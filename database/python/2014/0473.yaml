title: "Django: caching of anonymous pages could reveal CSRF token"
description: >
    It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
    A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
    different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a
    Django application.
