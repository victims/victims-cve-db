title: "Pillow: insecure temporary file creation"
description: >
    Jakub Wilk discovered that temporary files were insecurely created (via
    mktemp()) in the IptcImagePlugin.py, Image.py, JpegImagePlugin.py, and
    EpsImagePlugin.py files of Python Imaging Library. A local attacker
    could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to modify an
    arbitrary file accessible to the user running an application that uses
    the Python Imaging Library.
