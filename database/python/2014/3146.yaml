title: "python-lxml: clean_html input sanitization flaw"
description: >
        The clean_html() function, provided by the lxml.html.clean module,
        did not properly clean HTML input if it included non-printed
        characters (\x01-\x08). A remote attacker could use this flaw to
        serve malicious content to an application using the clean_html()
        function to process HTML, possibly allowing the attacker to inject
        malicious code into a website generated by this application.
