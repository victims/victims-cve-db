title: "Django: unexpected code execution using reverse()"
description: >
    A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
    constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
    crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import
    and execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges
    of the user running the application.
