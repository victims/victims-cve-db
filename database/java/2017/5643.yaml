title: "Apache Camel's Validation Component is vulnerable against SSRF via remote DTDs and XXE"
description: >
    The Validation Component of Apache Camel evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE).  The vulnerability is not given for SAX or StAX sources.
