title: "Spring Framework: reflected file download vulnerability"
description: >
    Under some situations, the Spring Framework is vulnerable to a Reflected File Download (RFD) attack.
    The attack involves a malicious user crafting a URL with a batch script extension that results in the
    response being downloaded rather than rendered and also includes some input reflected in the response.
