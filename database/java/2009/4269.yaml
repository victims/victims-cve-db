title: "Apache Derby: Weak password hash generation"
description: >
    The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication functionality for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces the size of the set of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that makes it easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating hash collisions, related to password substitution.
