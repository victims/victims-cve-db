title: "Apache Camel's Jackson and JacksonXML unmarshalling operation are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution attacks"
description: >
    Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object de-serialization vulnerability. Camel allows to specify such a type through the 'CamelJacksonUnmarshalType' property. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues.
