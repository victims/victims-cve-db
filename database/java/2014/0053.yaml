title: "Grails Resources plugin: Information disclosure"
description: >
    The Grails resources plug-in, a default dependency of Grails since 2.0.0, does not block access to resources located under /WEB-INF or /META-INF by default. This means that both configuration files and class files are publicly accessible when they should be private. Further, the filtering mechanism that applies any configured block does not normalize the requested URI before filtering allowing the block to be bypassed via directory traversal.
