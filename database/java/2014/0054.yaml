title: "Spring MVC: XML External Entities"
description: >
    Spring MVC's Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML and 
    neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable them.
    Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an option to control 
    the processing of XML external entities and that processing is now disabled by default.
