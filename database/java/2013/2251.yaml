title: "Apache Struts 2 arbitrary OGNL code execution via crafted parameters"
description: >
    In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:", "redirect:"
    or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will 
    be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the 
    possibility to inject server side code.
